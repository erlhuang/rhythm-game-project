Initially I had an idea of this game to be a mixture of DDR and Elite Beat
Agents (having a plot aspect to the rhythm game) but realized I would be
unable to complete the art for the miniplot. As it stands, this is simply a
DDR clone I chose to make for fun.


TODO:
  - Sliders
  - A lot of aesthetic improvements
    - Results screen
    - Pause screen
    - Would like more stylish aesthetics for chorus portion of song
    - Star power
  - Improvements to how im implementing level design...

the base of this game
